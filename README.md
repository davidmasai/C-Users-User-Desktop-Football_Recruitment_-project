# FIFA 18 Player Valuation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to help football clubs with tight budgets identify high-potential players with strong resale value. We use data from FIFA 18 to develop a classification model that predicts player profitability.

## Business Problem
Football clubs with limited budgets must make strategic player investments. Identifying undervalued players who can develop and be sold for a profit is crucial. Using historical FIFA 18 data, we apply machine learning techniques to predict which players will yield high resale value.

## Data Used
The dataset includes key attributes such as:
- Age
- Overall rating
- Potential rating
- Value
- Wage
- Special attributes (skills, weak foot, etc.)
- Position

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Scaled numerical features

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Market Value Efficiency:** Measures how efficiently a playerâ€™s current attributes contribute to their market value. Helps identify undervalued players.
- **Value-for-Money Index:** Evaluates a player's potential against their market value. Crucial for identifying high-potential players available at a low price.
- **Adjusted Value Efficiency Ratio (VER):** Combines several factors to quantify a player's expected growth relative to their current status.
- **Hidden Gem Metric:** Identifies players who perform well in terms of Adjusted VER, Market Value Efficiency, and Value-for-Money Index, while being undervalued.

### 3. Modeling Approach
- **Baseline Model:** Logistic Regression to establish a reference point.
  - Predictors: Age, Potential, Overall, Wage
  - Initial accuracy: 98%, Precision: 98%, Recall: 1.00
  - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.

- **Overfitting Analysis:**
  - Training Performance: Precision for Class 1 is 0.50, Recall for Class 1 is 1.00.
  - Indicators of Overfitting: High recall for class 1 in training but poor precision.

- **Decision Tree:** Captures non-linear patterns in player valuation.
- **Random Forest:** Provides better predictive power and robustness.

## Evaluation Metrics
We focused primarily on **precision**, ensuring that the model correctly identifies profitable players while minimizing false positives.

## Visualizations & Interpretations
We generated several visualizations to support our analysis:

### 1. Cluster Analysis of Players
![Cluster Analysis](images/4_clusters.png)
- Players were segmented into four clusters based on key attributes like age, potential, and market value.
- This helped us identify distinct groups of players who might be undervalued gems.

### 2. Age vs. Market Value
![Age vs. Market Value](images/age%20and%20value.webp)
- Younger players tend to have a higher resale value potential, while older players depreciate quickly.
- Clubs should prioritize investing in players under 25 to maximize resale opportunities.

### 3. Age Distribution
![Age Distribution](images/Age%20Distribution.png)
- The dataset is skewed towards younger players, which aligns with the scouting approach of top clubs.

### 4. Average Age vs. Wage and Market Value
![Average Age vs. Wage and Market Value](images/average%20age%20wage_value.png)
- Shows how wages and market value change with age.
- High-value players tend to be in the mid-20s, indicating peak resale potential.

### 5. Average Wage & Value by Rating
![Average Wage & Value by Rating](images/Average%20Wage_Value%20by%20Rating.png)
- Highlights how wage scales with a player's overall rating.
- Some players may be overpaid relative to their resale potential.

### 6. Overall & Potential vs. Age
![Overall & Potential vs. Age](images/Overall%20and%20Potential%20vs%20Age.png)
- Players with high potential tend to be younger, reinforcing the importance of scouting for future growth.

## Conclusion
- **Precision was the key metric**, ensuring we minimize investment in unprofitable players.
- **Random forest provided better insights** into which features drive future resale value.
- **Investing in young, high-potential players is the best strategy** for financial sustainability.
